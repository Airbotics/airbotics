# Contributing guide

Thank you for helping to make Airbotics better! We're excited you're interested in contributing, here are a couple of ways you can help. Please contact the maintainers if you want to know more about how to get involved.


## Reporting a bug

If you find a bug with Airbotics we'd love to learn about it, please follow these steps to inform us:

1. If you think the bug affects the security and privacy of our users, please refer to our [Security policy](SECURITY.md) instead.

2. Check the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Airbotics/airbotics/issues), if it's already there feel free and add a thumbs up or make a comment on it.

3. Otherwise, please open a new issue and include a title and description. The more relevant information you can include the better.

## Suggesting a feature

We're always looking for better ways to build and ship robotics code, if you find yourself wishing Airbotics had a feature that isn't built yet please open an issue on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work. If enough other people want the same feature we'll add it to our roadmap.

## Contributing code

We love to see pull requests from the community - anything from comments, to patches, to full features - they're all a great help. To save yourself from spending time working on something the maintainers might not want to merge into the project, please ping us first outlining roughly what you want to work on - we might be working on it already or have a good reason why we might not want to include it.
